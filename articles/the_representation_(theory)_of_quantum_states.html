                    <p>
                        My first course on quantum mechanics began with Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. I took the class
                        concurrent with linear algebra, and so I struggled through the mathematical formalisms: vector spaces,
                        dual spaces, inner products, tensor products. Maybe because it was all so new to me I didn't really question
                        why we chose the mathematical description we did. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That changed with Schrodinger. All of a sudden I had to throw out the inner products and 
                        the complex vectors in favor of integrals and functions. Then I began to wonder why. It seemed all so arbitrary.
                        It took four more years of math and three more courses on quantum mechanics before I began to put together an 
                        answer to this question. At least one that satisfied me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now parts of the story came fairly early. From the get-go, I was taught that quantum systems are linear. That's
                        what observations tell us at least. So using vectors to represent quantum states doesn't seem like a random choice (why
                        our vectors are complex is a completely different question). As it turned out, we're able to explain all of the 
                        representational choices from these sorts of first principles. We just need a more robust (and formal) mathematical 
                        framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>When we measure</b> quantum states, we need to get something. No component of the vector can be hidden from view.
                        Otherwise, when we project onto some other quantum state in the process of measurement, the information in the hidden 
                        component will never contribute. And for this same reason, we need to be able to compose and decompose states into
                        orthonormal bases. It may not look like it immediately, but that is a completeness condition. Or at least
                        that fact in conjunction with the superposition principle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Say we have an infinite set of quantum states&mdash;this is the most general case, and it shows up all over the place. We should
                        be able to add these states however we please to get a resultant superposition. And vice versa. The only condition being 
                        that the superposition vector must have a finite magnitude (the probability must be normalizable). Since the coefficients 
                        for each component exists in \(\mathbb{C}\), we require the sum of these coefficients (squared) converge, and the metric for
                        the resultant vector generated by this orthonormal basis follows immediately from this series, therefore all Cauchy sequences
                        in our vector space must converge. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means that quantum states must exist in a Hilbert space. Now all the initial questions just boil down to equivalences
                        between Hilbert spaces. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's recap real quick. Linearity gave us a vector space, and measurability gave us a Hilbert space. There is only one more
                        property we'll want to impose: separability. This choice seems to be a matter of convenience. It would be nice to be able to
                        specify a quantum state by doing a finite number of measurements along a finite number of orthogonal directions. But, as any
                        intro quantum mechanics course elucidates, there are many systems with infini-dimensional state spaces (just think about
                        a particle in a square well). So, we need the next best thing: a countable number of directions should specify our state 
                        uniquely. We say our Hilbert space is separable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now consider \(\ell^2(\mathbb{C})\), the space of square summable sequences. For any separable Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H} \)
                        we know there is a countable basis \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^\infty \). It is straightfoward to show that the map that takes each
                        \(x_i\) to the corresponding unit vector in \(\ell^2(\mathbb{C})\), \(e_i=(0, \dots, 1, 0, \dots) \), is an isometric
                        isomorphism. In the case that our state space is n-dimensional finite, \(\ell^2(\mathbb{C})\) reduces to \(\mathbb{C}^n \).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In essence, we've just shown that there is only one Hilbert space in quantum mechanics (up to dimensionality), and that 
                        our choice of representation is both valid and natural. Our choices of complex vector spaces or countably
                        spanned wavefunctions are consequences of linearity, measurability (completeness), and separability.
